## Project Topic:
Dialogflow Fulfillment Cross-Border Driver Monitoring Software 
Using Interactive Telegram Chatbot as Part of a Multipronged Approach to 
Fight the COVID-19 Pandemic

## Introduction: 
The COVID-19 outbreak and the resulting social distancing recommendations and related restrictions have led to numerous short-term changes in economic and social activity around the world. According to the ILO as reported on the UN news site, the risks of food insecurity are now emerging because of containment measures, including border closures implemented by governments. While it is important for governments to ensure a reduction in the risks of inter-border infections, it is equally critical to ensure that the food supply chain is not disrupted.

We have come up with a solution that implements cross-border driver monitoring to address the issue of food supply-chain disruption. The success of our solution is, however, dependent on the collaboration between governments at all levels, and the private sector as part of a multi-pronged approach to fight COVID-19. 

Cross-border driver monitoring helps governments reduce transmission and ensure the food supply chain is not disrupted. This will mitigate the collateral impacts on children, women, and vulnerable populations.

Thatâ€™s why we recommend that adopting and deploying cross-border driver monitoring system is a key milestone to reopen economies.

## Technology Components used:
1.	Python
    1.	  Flask Framework
2.	Google Dialogflow.
3.	Google App engine.
4.	Redis Data Store.

## How it works
Ensuring that the movement of food and other important materials can move across state borders safely, would require public health departments and the transport unions to:

1. Drivers that have been pre-tested or pre-screened for Covid-19 using rapid testing methods for covid-19 shall submit themselves to Truck Supervisors at Designated State Departure Depots.
2. The Truck Supervisors shall Register and approve all inter-state truck drivers for each trip, using the Covid-Border-Monitor Telegram Chat bot.
3. Educate all drivers on COVID-19 and how to conduct themselves while in transit.
4. The State Border Health Inspectors shall use the Covid-Border-Monitor Telegram Chat bot to monitor interstate drivers at state borders to verify from the digital travel database if the drivers have been approved for the ongoing trip.
5. The State Border Health Inspectors shall use the Covid-Border-Monitor Telegram Chat bot to update completed trips.

## Test User Credentials: 
1. Truck Supervisor
    1. USERID(Phone number) : 07034507918
    2. Password : 12345
2. State Border Health Inspector
    1. USERID(Phone number) : 07034507918
    2. Password : 12345
3. Test Truck Licence plate number
    msg-238bt
## Operational Guidelines
The State Border Health Inspectors can only update completed trips for trucks whose destination depot is the same as the state of operation of the State Border Health Inspector.
